\title{Forecasting daily COVID-19 spread in regions around the world.}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{Problem statement:}
The year 2020 will forever be remembered as the year the earth stood still. This is  primarily due to the spread of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019}{COVID-19}. As Data Scientists we seek to provide solutions to problems facing humanity and the world at large. In this regard we seek to develop a forecasting model that will predict the daily spread of COVID-19 in regions around the world.  Our model predicts the number of daily new cases in regions around the world in order to help policy makers plan and manage the COVID-19 pandemic.  

\section{Dataset summary and EDA:}

\subsection{Background of dataset:}
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition of research groups and companies (including Kaggle) to prepare the \href{https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge}{COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)} to attempt to address \href{https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks}{key open scientific questions on COVID-19}. Those questions are drawn from \href{https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/03-11-2020/standing-committee-on-emerging-infectious-diseases-and-21st-century-health-threats-virtual-meeting-1}{National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicineâ€™s (NASEM)} and the \href{https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/Global_Research_Forum_FINAL_VERSION_for_web_14_feb_2020.pdf?ua=1}{World Health Organization (WHO)}.

\subsection{Data sources:}
The sources of data used in this project can be obtained from \href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-5/overview}{Kaggle Dataset}

\subsection{Actual data:}
Since the accuracy of such a model is dependent on the freshness of the data, the most up to date data can be found \href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-5/overview}{here}

\subsection{Actual data used in project:}
In this project we use frozen dataset i.e dataset that has been frozen in time and this dataset can be found \href{https://github.com/acquayefrank/MLDM2020-Project/tree/master/data}{here}

\subsection{Basic exploratory data analysis}
